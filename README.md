Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It ensures that software applications are reliable, secure, and scalable while driving innovation across multiple industries.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference) which shifted software development from an ad-hoc process to a more structured, disciplined approach.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s) which introduced encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code.
The Agile Manifesto & DevOps Revolution (2001 - Present) which transformed how software is developed and deployed, leading to faster release cycles and improved collaboration.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning-In this phase, project goals, scope, resources, and risks are defined.
Requirement analysis-Detailed functional and non-functional requirements are gathered from stakeholders.
Design-The system architecture, database structure, and interface design are created.
Implementation-Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Testing-The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Doployment-The software is released to users, either through a full rollout or phased deployment.
Maintenance and support-The software is continuously monitored for bugs, security updates, and performance improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is ideal for well-defined, high-risk projects needing strict documentation such as military projects, while Agile suits dynamic, customer-driven projects requiring flexibility such as mobile apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
